## Technical Challenges
#### Being able to implement everything from my mock-up:

• My background is in design and I enjoy making fun and easy to use interfaces but didn’t know how to implement certain features and wasn’t able to create my design exactly like my mock up. The solution to this issue was “killing my babies”. By this I mean that even though I made something that I really liked, I needed to be able to cut my losses when necessary to be able to complete the project on time and satisfy the requirements.

#### Hooking up the front-end to the back-end

• Having some experience with front-end development, hooking up the back end was a big hurdle for me. Having to figure out how the different sets of data were to be stored inside of the database was the first step. After talking with fellow classmates I was able to clearly understand how I wanted the information to be stored, which really helped me get this project off the ground.

#### File Uploads

• Trying to figure out how to get file uploads was a difficult task. I tried to implement a file uploader but after a day or two it just wasn’t working. To solve this issue I decided to store the name of the file into the database and used thymeleaf to pull the names of the files, to mock the file upload process.
