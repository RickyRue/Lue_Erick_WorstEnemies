## Installation

### Pre-requisites

Google Chrome browser is recommended, but not required; most browsers will probably work.

## Usage

Visit `src/main/Public/index.html` in your web browser to view the website.

Log in with an email and a password, or click create an account and fill out the required fields to get to the cards
view. (User account creation is superficial right now and still needs to be implemented)

Click on one of the cards to show the "Next Question" button and then click it. Repeat until you get to the Chosen Cards
Table. Your selected cards will be shown in bold.

Click on the profile link to see your worst enemies and submit feedback about answering the questions.
